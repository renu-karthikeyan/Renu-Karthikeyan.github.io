Hi! I'm Renu Karthikeyan! I grew up in the Dallas Area, and currently work as a financial analyst in Denver, Colorado. I love Data Science and Analytics! 

I am currently enrolled as a graduate student in the Masters in Data Science program at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. I graduated with my Bachelors Degree in Finance in December 2021 from The University of Texas at Dallas with major and Latin honors (magna cum laude).

I am  passionate about using data to drive insights and improve decision-making, With a background in finance, I have developed a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and critical thinking, and am eager to apply these skills to real-world problems. I am interested in pursuing the business analytics track as it aligns with my career aspirations in analytics.
